A (non-exhaustive) list of references about sea ice - Atmospheric Boundary Layer coupling. 

I sorted out the references in the 5 categories below:


## 1. Impact of prescribed sea ice boundary conditions on the ABL in atmospheric models (often LES). 

The focus of these studies is on the response of the ABL to various sea ice boundary conditions (but nothing i could find about the feedback effects on sea ice).

A series of idealized high-resolution simulations with Polar WRF is performed for several spatial distributions of ice floes and leads for two values of sea ice concentration (0.5 and 0.9) and several ambient wind speed profiles.

* _A theory for the mean ice thickness and the Transpolar Drift in the Arctic Ocean is developed. Two distinct regimes: a thin ice regime in the eastern Arctic and a thick ice regime in the western Arctic. In the eastern Arctic, the ice drift is controlled by a balance between wind and ocean drag, while the ice thickness is controlled by heat loss to the atmosphere. In contrast, in the western Arctic, the ice thickness is determined by a balance between wind and internal ice stress, while the drift is indirectly controlled by heat loss to the atmosphere. The basic predictions for ice thickness, heat loss, ice volume, and ice export from the theory compare well with an idealized, coupled ocean–ice numerical model over a wide range of parameter space._

* _Goal of this thesis lies on improving our current understanding of convective processes and the related turbulent fluxes in the polar atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) over both the sea ice covered regions and over the open ocean at the sea ice edge. Obs (aircraft)-based results are supplemented by modeling studies using a simple boxmodel and a one-dimensional mesoscale model. For this purpose, we use a 1D version of the MEsoscale TRAnsport and Stream model (METRAS, Schlünzen, 1988), which is non-hydrostatic and anelastic. The applied parametrisations are a mixing length
closure (ML), a counter-gradient closure (CG), and a so-called eddy-diffusivity mass-flux closure (EDMF)._

* Goal: provide reliable Arctic sea ice prediction on SEASONAL timescales.  Compare a MITGCM forced config with a coupled config with Polar WRF. “The two-way coupling has better performance in terms of sea ice extent, concen- tration, thickness and sea surface temperature (SST), especially in summer. This result indicates that sea-ice–ocean– atmosphere interaction plays a crucial role in controlling Arctic summertime sea ice distribution.

* _Demonstrate that using a dynamically coupled ocean and sea ice model in the European Centre for Medium- Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System results in improved sea ice edge position forecasts in the Northern Hemisphere in the medium range. Further, this improves forecasts of boundary layer temperature and humidity downstream of the sea ice edge in some regions during periods of rapid change in the sea ice, compared to forecasts in which the sea surface temperature anomalies and sea ice concentration do not evolve throughout the forecasts._

* _Abstract: The purpose of this study is to present the impacts of a fully interactive coupling between an atmospheric and a sea ice model over the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Canada. The impacts are assessed in terms of the atmospheric and sea ice forecasts produced by the coupled numerical system. The ocean-ice model has been developed at the Maurice Lamontagne Institute, where it runs operationally at a horizontal resolution of 5 km and is driven (one-way coupling) by atmospheric model forecasts provided by the Meteorological Service of Canada (MSC). In this paper the importance of two-way coupling is assessed by comparing the one-way coupled version with a two-way coupled version in which the atmospheric model interacts with the sea ice model during the simulation. The impacts are examined for a case in which the sea ice conditions are changing rapidly. Two atmospheric model configurations have been studied. The first one has a horizontal grid spacing of 24 km, which is the operational configuration used at the Canadian Meteorological Centre. The second one is a high-resolution configuration with a **4-km horizontal grid spacing**. A 48-h forecast has been validated using satellite images for the ice and the clouds, and also using the air temperature and precipitation observations. It is shown that the two-way coupled system improves the atmospheric forecast and has a **direct impact on the sea ice forecast.** It is also found that forecasts are improved with a fine resolution that better resolves the physical events, fluxes, and forcing. The coupling technique is also briefly described and discussed._
